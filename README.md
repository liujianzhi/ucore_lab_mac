### Run ucore_lab on mac

---

This manual will guide you run ucore_lab on macOS Catalina.


First, make sure you have installed Xcode or CommandLineTools.

``` bash
xcode-select --install
```



Then install [Homebrew](brew.sh). (make sure you are using .., otherwise below opreations will extrrrrrrremely slow.)

``` bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

Minimal installation

``` bash
brew install i386-elf-gdb gdb cgdb qemu
```



Then you could run ucore_lab. 

The following steps are able to explain the changes to the standard code for running on Mac. <B>  !!!!!If you use my code, there is no need to make the following changes!!!!!  </B>

>  Debugging ucore_lab needs change every code in Makfile like
>
>  ``` makefile
>  TERMINAL        :=gtk-Terminal
>  $(V)$(TERMINAL) -e "$(bash)"
>  ```
>
> Into 
>
>  ``` makefile
>  TERMINAL        :=osascript
>  $(V)$(TERMINAL) -e 'tell app "Terminal" to do script "cd $(mkdir);$(bash)"'
>  ```
>  And add this code on the top of Makefile
>
>  ``` makefile
>  mkdir	:=$(shell pwd)/$(lastword $(MAKEFILE_LIST))
>  mkdir   :=$(shell dirname $(mkdir))
>  ```
>
>
>  Because the gtk-Terminal is not support for Mac. We use apple script to create another termainal window.
